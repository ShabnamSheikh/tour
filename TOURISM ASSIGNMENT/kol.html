    <h2>ASHTAMUDI LAKE</h2>
    <p>
        A gateway to the backwaters, Ashtamudi Lake is the most popular place in Kollam, which is surrounded by lush green trees and swaying coconut palms. This 16 km long lake is the second largest lake in Kerala, which has found its way into the sea through the Neendakara estuary. This place is so beautiful that tourists from different parts of the country and abroad, visit this natural paradise to catch a glimpse of one of many splendours of Ashtamudi. A lot of tourists come here to experience boat ride, which gives a glimpse of village life, natural habitat, and abundant flora. This lake is known for its panoramic beauty and eight channels that connects to one lake. It is because of its eight 'arms' or channels, that the lake is named Ashtamudi.
        Ashtamudi Lake is more of a commercial centre as it has been witnessing innumerable tourists every year on account of its exotic beauty spread all across the town. The history of this lake is unknown, however, its discussion is found in the texts of Ibn Battuta. The name Ashtamudi is derived from its structure in the form of eight diverging branches.
