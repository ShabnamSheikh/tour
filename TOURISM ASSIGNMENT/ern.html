    <h2>BOLGATTY PALACE</h2>
    <p>
        In the island of Bolgatty lies Kochi’s famous Bolgatty Palace. It is one of the oldest existing Dutch palaces in the world. It was built by the Dutch traders in the year 1744 and later was extended and gardens were landscaped around it.
This was at that time the Governor’s palace for the commander of the Dutch Malabar. In the year 1909 it was leased out to the British, hence serving as the home of the British Governors. It was also the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj.
Later on in the year 1947, when India attained independence from the British, the palace became the state’s property and then later was converted into a heritage hotel resort. Now this palace has a swimming pool along with a 9 hole golf course and an ayurvedic centre.
There is also daily Kathakali performances making this a perfect place for both Foreign and Indian holidaymakers.
Bolgatty Palace is built on the European model. The building material used were the most commonly found sea rocks, clay tiles, teak woods, clay bricks and mount bricks. This is mostly built like a mansion to occupy the colonial officials. There are many living rooms, a swimming pool, and golf court. There are many boat platforms built around its shore to reach here from all direction of this Island. This palace is totally built in luxury and comforts articles brought from European countries. There are splendid works on woods in and all around the palace which are very beautifully carved. Introduction of colored glass were fixed on windows and doors of this palace. Its roofs are mostly placed with clay tiles. There are one to two storied floors built here. It has pillared and verandahs and many pavilions were built on the shore surroundings.
