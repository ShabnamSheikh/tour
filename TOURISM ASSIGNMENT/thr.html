    <h2>ATHIRAPILLY WATERFALLS</h2>
    
    <p>
        Athirappally Falls is known for its picturesque vistas; its formation resembles the popular Naigara Falls in the USA. So, Athirappilly Waterfalls is fondly called as "The Naigara of India". It is also the largest waterfalls in Kerala.
        The dense vegetation of Vazhachal forest division is located around Athirappilly Falls. It is said that it is one of the best bio-diversity hotspots in Kerala. Interestingly, Athirappilly - Vazhachal region is a home to four kinds of Great Indian Hornbill. The lush vegetation supports rich wildlife and avifauna. The forest reserve is also a habitat of elephants, bisons, tigers, leopards and many other animals. Hence, the region of Athirappilly is one of the best wildlife destinations in Kerala.
        Athirapally is the land of rivers and forests and great waterfalls!The destination houses the  largest waterfall in Kerala, the Athirapally waterfall, a major tourist attraction. This patch in Sholayar ranges so beautifully intertwined with lush green forest cover and sizzling silver cascades and located central to Cochin and River Nila(Bharathapuzha), is a treat for the eyes during the monsoon.Swollen Chalakkudy river, Charpa, Vazhachal and Athirapally are ideal places where the monsoon is to be enjoyed.
 Local communities along the Chalakudy river banded together to stop the construction of a hydroelectric dam upstream from Athirapally Waterfall. The proposed dam would have submerged more than 140 hectares of forest, dried up extensive riparian areas downstream and destroyed Athirapally Waterfall, one of several scenic waterfalls important to the local tourism industry.The dam also would have destroyed the critical habitat of many important species, including the rare Cochin Forest Cane Turtle, the endangered Great Indian Hornbill, the Lion-Tailed Macaque and the Nilgiri Langur.
