    <h2>SILENT VALLEY NATIONAL PARK</h2>
    <p>
        Silent Valley National Park is a beautiful representation of the last remaining rain forest of Kerala. Historically it’s a paradigm of people’s movement to protect the forest. Silent Valley was declared as National Park in 1984 and formally inaugurated in the year 1985. Initially there was only 89.52 sq.km. area under the Division which forms the core zone of the National Park. In 2007, an area of 148 sq.km. was added to this Division as buffer zone. In 1914, Silent Valley forests were declared as Reserved Forest. Till 1921, Silent Valley was part of South Malabar Forest Division with headquarters at Nilambur. During 1921, it came under control of Palakkad Forest Division and managed so until 1988.
        The onset of Summers in Silent Valley is from April and it stays till May. The park is usually dry and warm during this time, with scorching heat in the afternoon. Lots of animals can be seen out around in the open, usually near water sources where they herd up to drink water. Summer season is an ideal time to visit the Silent Valley National Park to spot animals with their offsprings out in the open, along with various rare birds of the region. And just like a ny other region in Tamil Nadu, this place too receives infrequent showers every now and then in the otherwise dry and warm climate of the region.
        The flora and fauna found here makes one wonder if this ecosystem has survived since the very beginning of time. From tigers, leopards, elephants, snakes, Lion-Tailed Macaques and Malabar Giant Squirrels to moths, bugs and toads, the diversity in fauna is breath-taking. Along with them one can view over 1000 species of flowering plants and another 110 species of orchids that enchant all who see them. Over 400 species of moths and 200 species of butterflies have been catalogued here. The 128 species of beetles deservea special mention since 10 of them were previously unknown to mankind.
Many have passed through here since then but none have been able to put to words the exact feelings or detail the emotions evoked by the experience these forests have to offer. It is something to be observed first-hand, this absolute gift of nature, with secrets that mankind is yet to truly understand.
        In many ways and the park offers several eco-tourism packages for travellers like trekking and camping.
